# TrashBot.py
A bot that monitors /hot for low effort posts


This is a simple bot based on the submission statement bot also in the r/ModGuide script library.  The bot monitors posts on your subreddit and once a post is more than five hours old and if it has an upvote ratio of 45% or lower it will be removed.  This bot was written specifically for r/lol without any type of notification to users of post removals.
